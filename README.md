1> This android application allows users to query the experts on the other side of the application. The queries could be any technical doubt. The user can also take a quiz and test their knowledge. The user is also allowed to read other queries and it's answer to help themselves.
2> The app starts with a login page, basic login with userID and password, login/register via Google and register manually is tagged in the page. The user can choose the appropriate option.
3> After loging in or registering the user is directed to the home page, with the contents of queries and it's answers,  also mentioned the details of expert and the person who asked the query.
4> The bottom navigation bar allows user to switch to different fragments, like home, quiz, and ask doubt.
5> In the quiz fragment, the user is allowed to take quiz and get answer at the same instant.
6> In the ask doubt fragment, the user types in the query in the text area provided and it gets stored in the database attached with the users details.
7> A left-side drawer menu is attached to the main page, which allows user to visit their profile and update them, or they can log out from it.

The project is complete, considering the main and the basic idea, but it lacks features and looks. I will be working on it again in future to add some features like, searching the question in the main page and suggesting related question when the user is about to post the question.
